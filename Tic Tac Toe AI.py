# ## Tic Tac Toe - Optimal Win Strategy AI with Minimax Backtracking

# An improved modification of the original code credited to 'javacodingcommunity'

# Improvements include:
# - running the game in a loop (play again feature)
# - checks for win before draw (in the event that the last move leads to a victory)
# - ends game when a win or draw occurs (instead of asking user to enter position)
# - switches alternately between computer and user for who starts first
